# Face to Age

In this example, we have a dataset 'images.csv' of more than 23k images of 48x48 pixels each.

(the dataset can be found here: "https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/certification/face_to_age/images.csv")

Every single image represents the face of a person. We also have a column with the age of each person.

The goal of this work is to be able to predict the age of a person just by a picture of her face.
